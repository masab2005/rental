# Car Rental Frontend

This is a Vite + React + Tailwind scaffold generated to work with your backend.
The backend endpoints documentation file (as provided) is available at `/mnt/data/ENDPOINTS_DOCUMENTATION.md` on the environment where this project will run.

## Quick start

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (default: `http://localhost:5001`).
2. Install:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Notes
- Auth tokens are stored in `localStorage`.
- The frontend expects the backend to be running and reachable at `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
